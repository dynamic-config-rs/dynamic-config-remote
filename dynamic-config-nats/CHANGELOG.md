# Changelog

All notable changes to `dynamic-config-nats` are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Before 1.0, a breaking change bumps the **minor** version and anything else
bumps the patch. A change to the minimum supported Rust version is breaking.

<!-- Keep this template. Add entries under `Unreleased` as you go, and move
     the whole block under a new version heading at release time.
     (Spelled `_Unreleased_` here so cargo-release's `exactly = 1` search
     for the real heading matches only the real heading.)

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-11

### Changed

- Released in lockstep with `dynamic-config` 0.2.0, where the attribute
  declares and the builder configures. This crate's own surface is
  unchanged; its examples and docs now configure through the builder.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-10

### Breaking

- A watch callback that panics ends the watch with an error.

## [0.0.1] — 2026-08-10

Initial release.

### Added

- `Nats` as an `AsyncRemoteSource` over a JetStream KV bucket: one key holds
  a whole configuration document.
- A real push watch over the bucket's watch stream — no polling; a deleted
  key is not delivered as a change.
- Credentials through `async-nats`'s own `ConnectOptions` (re-exported), and
  `from_client` for a connection the program already has.
